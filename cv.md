## 📝 About me

My goal is to start a career as a junior front-end developer and develop to a full understanding of building the architecture of complex projects.

Currently I work as an auto electrician diagnostician. While working as an auto electrician-diagnostician, he acquired the skill of analytical thinking, the skill of collecting data necessary for diagnostics and troubleshooting when communicating with a client, and the skill of working in a team.

## 💾 Code examples

Code that performs the linear search algorithm for the value of an element in an array

```
const arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 10, 8, 6, 9, 7, 5];
let count = 0;

function LinearSearch(arr, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        count += 1;
        if (arr[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

## 👨‍💻 Experience
I created my own social network while studying the course react the way of the samurai. During the development process, I gained skills in working with such libraries as React, Redux, React-Redux, creating asynchronous requests to the server using the axios library, using Redux-form, Redux-thunk. Gained the understanding and skill of creating a three-layer architecture of applications: UI, BLL, DAL. Link to the source code of this project

While learning JavaScript, I created an oscillating circuit calculator and a text encoder. Both programs are my authorship. While studying JavaScript, I learned how to solve all sorts of algorithmic problems and work with the Git version control system.
The results of the work can be viewed on Github Pages:
